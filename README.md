# Greenplum overview

Greeplum is an MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) database engine, based
on PostgreSQL.

A Greenplum cluster consists of a "master" server, and multiple "segment"
servers. All user data resides in the segments, the master contains only
metadata. The master server, and all the segments, share the same schema.

Users always connect to the master server, which divides up the query into
fragments that are executed in the segments, sends the fragments to the
segments, and collects the results.

# Compiling on OSX

All the following steps are automated by scripts at https://github.com/greenplum-db/ci-infrastructure/tree/master/scripts. If you want to do it **manually**, please follow instructions below.

## Dependencies

* Java 1.6 (https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US)
* gcc 4.4.2 for OSX 106, assume installed at `/opt` with `/opt/gcc_env-osx106.sh` available (http://intranet.greenplum.com/releng/tools/gcc/4.4.2/osx106-gcc-4.4.2.tar.gz)
* Xcode 6.3.2 commandline (other than default Xcode 7.0+) to avoid `long long int is 64bit` error during configure
* All other dependencies are tracked by `./gpAux/releng/make/dependencies/ivy.xml` and will be retrieved automatically during build

## Environment

```
ulimit -n 65535;
export GPROOT=`pwd`/gpAux;
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.6`;
source /opt/gcc_env-osx106.sh;
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9;

# ensure `make sync_tools` can install under /opt
sudo chown -R $USERNAME:admin /opt

# HTTP auth parameters for ivy to download dependent artifacts
export IVYREPO_HOST=
# If the realm has white space, enclose the value in double quotes
export IVYREPO_REALM=
export IVYREPO_USER=
export IVYREPO_PASSWD=
```

Add following lines to `/etc/sysctl.conf` file (create one if it isnâ€™t there)
```
kern.sysv.shmmax=2147483648
kern.sysv.shmmin=1
kern.sysv.shmmni=64
kern.sysv.shmseg=16
kern.sysv.shmall=524288
kern.maxfiles=65535
kern.maxfilesperproc=65536
```

Run the following command as root for the changes to take effect:

```
sudo sh -c "cat /etc/sysctl.conf | xargs -n1 sysctl -w"
```

If you get an error for shmmni, ignore and proceed. 

## Build

[Build Instructions](gpAux/BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS)

```
cd gpAux/
make sync_tools
# build optimized 32bit
make dist enable_gphdfs=yes ARCH_BIT=GPOS_32BIT;
```

NOTE: If you hit `pljava` issue, just disable it in the `Makefile` under `gpAux`.

## Compatibility Fix

Find `libz.1.dylib` under `greenplum-db-devel/` and remove it.

# Code layout

The directory layout of the repository follows the same general layout as
upstream PostgreSQL. There are changes compared to PostgreSQL throughout the
codebase, but a few larger additions worth noting:

`gpAux/`
	Contains Greenplum-specific extensions such as gpfdist and gpmapreduce.
	Some extension directories are submodules due to GPL license conflicts.

`gpMgmt/`
	Contains Greenplum-specific command-line tools for managing the
	cluster. Scripts like gpinit, gpstart, gpstop live here. They are
	mostly written in Python.

`doc/`
	In PostgreSQL, the user manual lives here. In Greenplum, the user
	manual is distributed separately (see http://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io), and
	only the reference pages used to build man pages are here.

`src/backend/cdb/`
	Contains larger Greenplum-specific backend modules. For example,
	communication between segments, turning plans into parallelizable
	plans, mirroring, distributed transaction and snapshot management,
	etc. "cdb" stands for "Cluster Database" - it was a workname used in
	the early days. That name is no longer used, but the "cdb" prefix
	remains.

`src/backend/gpopt`
	Contains the so-called "translator" library, for using the ORCA
	optimizer with Greenplum. The translator library is written in C++
	code, and contains glue code for translating plans and queries between
	the DXL format used by ORCA, and the PostgreSQL internal
	representation. This goes unused, unless building with --enable-orca.

`src/backend/gp_libpq_fe`
	A slightly modified copy of libpq. The master node uses this to
	connect to segments, and to send fragments of a query plan to segments
	for execution. It is linked directly into the backend, it is not a
	shared library like libpq.

`src/backend/fts`
	FTS is a process that runs in the master node, and periodically polls
	the segments to maintain the status of each segment.


# Regression tests

```
make installcheck-good  ## default regression tests
make installcheck-bugbuster  ## optional extra/heavier regression tests
## You can add TT=<test name> variable to the make command to run a single test
```

The PostgreSQL `check` target does not work. Setting up a Greenplum cluster
is more complicated than a single-node PostgreSQL installation, and no-one's
done the work to have `make check` create a cluster. Create a cluster
manually or use `gpAux/gpdemo/`, and run `make installcheck-good` against
that. Patches are welcome!

The PostgreSQL `installcheck` target does not work either, because some
tests are known to fail with Greenplum. The `installcheck-good` schedule
excludes those tests.

Example regression test run:
```
## Go to $GPHOME (configure --prefix install location)
source greenplum_path.sh
cd gpAux/gpdemo/
make cluster

## After make cluster, export PGPORT and MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY
source gpdemo-env.sh
make installcheck-good
```

## Development with Docker (alpha)

Docker can be set up via script or manually:

### Docker setup script for mounted (auto-sync) volume 

This uses the beta, native macOS app for docker. Follow the readme and the script at gpdb4/docker/mounted_volume/

### Docker manual setup

We provide a docker image with all dependencies required to compile and test
GPDB. You can view the dependency dockerfile at `./docker/base/Dockerfile`.
The image is hosted on docker hub at `pivotaldata/gpdb4-devel`. This docker
image is currently under heavy development.

### Running regression tests with Docker

1. Create a docker host with 8gb RAM and 4 cores
    ```bash
    docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-cpu-count 4 --virtualbox-disk-size 50000 --virtualbox-memory 8192 gpdb
    eval $(docker-machine env gpdb)
    ```

2. Build your code on gpdb4-devel rootfs
    ```bash
    cd [path/to/gpdb4]
    docker build .
    # image beefc4f3 built
    ```
    The top level Dockerfile will automatically sync your current working
    directory into the docker image. This means that any code you are working
    on will automatically be built and ready for testing in the docker context

3. Log into docker image and start ssh
    ```bash
    docker run -it beefc4f3
    # on docker image
    ./docker/start_ssh.bash
    ```

4. As `gpadmin` user run `make cluster`
    ```bash
    su gpadmin
    source /usr/local/gpdb/greenplum_path.sh
    cd gpAux/gpdemo
    make cluster
    source gpdemo-env.sh
    ```

5. Run `installcheck-good`
    ```bash
    cd ../../
    # wd is /workspace/gpdb
    make installcheck-good
    ```
